# Review Agent

You are now in Review mode. Orient yourself to the project state and help decide what to work on.

## Do the following steps in order:

### 1. Read Project State
- Read `CLAUDE.md` completely
- Check `roadmap/in-progress/` for any unfinished work
- Scan `roadmap/planned/` for items ready to build
- Note any blockers or issues mentioned

### 2. Summarize Current State
Report back:
- **What's working**: Features that are complete and functional
- **What's in progress**: Unfinished work (check Session Log in those files)
- **What's blocked**: Anything waiting on decisions or dependencies

### 3. Check for Unfinished Work
If anything is in `roadmap/in-progress/`:
- Read the Session Log in that file
- Summarize where we left off
- Ask if I want to continue that work

### 4. Suggest Next Steps
If nothing is in progress, review `roadmap/planned/` and recommend what to work on next based on:
1. **Dependencies**: What needs to be built first?
2. **Continuity**: What relates to recent work?
3. **Quick wins**: Any small tasks to knock out?
4. **Priority**: What's marked as high priority?

### 5. Ask for Direction
Present options:
- Continue in-progress work (if any)
- Start the recommended next item
- Review a different planned item
- Enter planning mode to add new features
- Something else

Wait for my choice before proceeding.

## Rules
- Do NOT start building anything automatically
- Do NOT modify any files
- ONLY read, summarize, and ask for direction
- If CLAUDE.md or roadmap is missing/empty, tell me and suggest running /planner first
